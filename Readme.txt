# Scenario

Yoobee College offers postgraduate programmes that include several courses, students, and teachers. To manage academic information efficiently,
the college plans to develop a College Course Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), based on the ER diagram designed in
Week 3 – Activity 3. The system models core entities such as Student, Teacher, and Course, along with their relationships, to accurately represent
the college’s academic structure.

The system allows students to enroll in courses and teachers to be assigned to teach specific courses. It is designed to display the total number
of students enrolled in MSE800 (Professional Software Engineering) and to list all teachers teaching MSE801 (Research Methods). This project 
demonstrates how an ER diagram can be transformed into an OOP-based solution to handle real-world academic data management at Yoobee College.
